## Hi, I'm Shivam 👋  

Backend-leaning full-stack developer who enjoys building **scalable systems**, designing **clean architectures**, and understanding how things work under the hood.

I learn by building real projects — not just tutorials — and I care deeply about **system design, cloud infrastructure, and performance**.

---

### 🚀 What I’m working on
- Designing backend-heavy applications with **Node.js & Next.js**
- Exploring **AWS cloud architecture** (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, load balancing)
- Building projects that showcase **real-world engineering decisions**
- Preparing for **open-source contributions (GSoC path)**

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack
**Languages**
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- SQL  

**Backend**
- Node.js, Express
